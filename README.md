GNOME Shell Extension: Settings Center
====================================
Settings shortcuts : gnome-tweak-tool, dconf-editor, gconf-editor, gnome-session-properties, gnome-shell-extension-prefs, seahorse and nvidia-settings. You can add your own.  This is an updated version for newer GNOME versions (up to 3.14.2).
You can install it easily from the GNOME Extensions page: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/911/settingscenter/

Else, you'll have it install it yourself by copying the folder SettingsCenter@Vistaus.nl to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions and restarting the shell afterwards (ALT+F2 --> r)
